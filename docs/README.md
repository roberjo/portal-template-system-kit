## Key Concepts

### Component-Based Architecture

Our application is built using a component-based architecture, where UI elements are broken down into reusable components. This approach improves maintainability, reusability, and testability.

### Type Safety

We prioritize type safety throughout the codebase, using TypeScript to catch errors at compile time and provide better developer experience.

### State Management

We use MobX for state management, following a domain-driven approach with stores for different parts of the application.

### Design System

We follow a consistent design system, implemented with Tailwind CSS, to ensure a cohesive user experience across the application.
