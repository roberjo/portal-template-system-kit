# Recommended Setup for React SPA Projects

This document provides comprehensive recommendations for setting up and maintaining a React Single Page Application (SPA) project, covering everything from development environment to code quality, testing, and deployment.

## Development Environment

- **Package Manager**: 
  - Use npm, yarn, or pnpm with lock files for consistent installations
  - Configure `.npmrc` or equivalent for consistent configurations across team members
  - Consider using Bun for faster installations

- **Node Version Management**: 
  - Include `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` file to specify Node.js version requirements
  - Document required versions in README

- **Environment Variables**: 
  - Implement `.env` files with `.env.example` templates
  - Document all required environment variables
  - Use type-checking for environment variables

## Core Development Tools

- **Build System**: 
  - Use Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
  - Configure build optimization settings for production
  - Set up different build modes (development, staging, production)

- **TypeScript**: 
  - Configure strict type checking
  - Maintain separate tsconfig files for different environments (app, node, tests)
  - Set up incremental builds for faster compilation

- **Module Aliasing**: 
  - Configure path aliases in tsconfig.json and build tools
  - Use consistent import patterns
  - Avoid deep relative imports

## Code Quality Tools

- **ESLint**:

## Code Review Guidelines

- **PR Size**: 
  - Keep PRs focused and small (under 400 lines when possible)
  - Encourage atomic commits

- **PR Templates**: 
  - Use structured templates for consistency
  - Include sections for description, testing, screenshots

- **Branch Protection**: 
  - Configure branch protection with required status checks

## Implementation Strategy

When implementing these recommendations:

1. **Start with the basics**: Build system, TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier
2. **Add testing infrastructure**: Unit tests first, then component and e2e tests
3. **Implement CI/CD**: Start with basic checks, then add more advanced testing
4. **Improve gradually**: Apply stricter rules to new code first
5. **Document as you go**: Keep documentation up-to-date with implementations
6. **Measure impact**: Track metrics like build time, test coverage, and developer satisfaction

By implementing these recommendations, you'll create a robust foundation for your React SPA that promotes code quality, developer productivity, and sustainable growth.
